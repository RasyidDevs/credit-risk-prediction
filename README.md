# Credit Risk Prediction  

This project was developed during my **Data Scientist Internship at IDX Partnership**.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan will result in a **Good Loan** or a **Bad Loan**, based on historical loan application and borrower data.

## 📌 Business Context  
A multifinance company faces challenges in accurately assessing credit risk.  
Wrong loan approval decisions can increase default rates and financial losses.  
Therefore, a more objective and scalable **data-driven approach** is needed.  

---

## 🎯 Business Objective  
- Build a predictive model for credit risk.  
- Support better loan approval decisions.  
- Reduce default rates and minimize financial losses.  

---

## 🔍 Analytics Approach  
- **Analytical Question:** How can historical loan data be used to predict the risk of new applicants?  
- **Output:** A classification model that categorizes applicants into **Good Loan** (Fully Paid, Does not meet credit policy but Fully Paid) and **Bad Loan** (Charged Off, Default, Late, or Does not meet credit policy but Charged Off).
